'''
Whenever i need to enter a multi line string i can't do it by convention
or what i have learnt of enclosing the string message in ' ' or " ".
''' 

# ILLUSTRATION 1 OF ENTERING SINGLE-LINE STRING :-

string_1='hello, how are you'
print(string_1)

# ILLUSTRATION 2 OF ENTERING MULTI-LINE STRING :-

# string_2='Hello how are you
# hope you are doing well
# good bye!!'

'''
ILLUSTRATION 2 IS HSOWING ERROR BECAUSE IN PYTHON STRING CAN BE READ BY
THE STRING VARIABLE ONLY IN A SINGLE LINE BY CONVENTIONAL METHOD

------> BUT, IF I HAVE TO GIVE INPUT MULTI-LINE STRING THEN I WILLL HAVE 
TO USE 
''' '''
  OR
""" """
AND WRITE THE MESSAGE IN BETWEEN SINGLE OR DOUBLE QUOTES.

JUST LIKE I AM DOING TO WRITE MULTI-LINE COMMENTS.
'''

# ILLUSTRATION 3 OF ENTERING MULTI-LINE STRING :-
string_3='''Hello how are you
hope you are doing well
good bye !!!'''
print("The message is :-"'\n'+string_3)
