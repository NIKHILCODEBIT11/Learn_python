name="Harish" # ---------->> I CAN USE BOTH ' ' AS WELL AS " " QUOTES
another_name='haria' # --->> TO DEFINE AND ASSIGN STRING.
print("The name is"+name)


# TRY TO PRINT He said, "I want to eat an apple"

# Method-1 :-
print("He said,","\"I want to eat an apple\"")


# Method-2 :-
print('He said, "I want to eat an apple"')
'''
Since i can use both ' ' as well as " " to write string so whenever i 
enclose my string with either of them then i can use directly the other
left out quotation directly without using \ like :-
\" \"    OR    \' \'
'''

# Method-3 :-
print('He said,','\'I want to eat an apple\'')

# Method-4 :-
print("He said, 'I want to eat an apple'")
